Xamarin Components
==================

Component binaries haven't been included in this archive to keep the size down. Before building
the solution, restore the components as follows:

1) In the iOS project, open Components and double-click on each one (make sure you're logged in
   to your Xamarin account or it won't download)
2) Close the solution and re-open it
3) Both iOS and Android projects should now show components and references to them

At this stage you can rebuild the solution, but the first attempt may only download the missing
NuGet packages, so on completion you will probably have to rebuild it again.
